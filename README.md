# SyntacticSemanticEvolution
Many studies and publications in the field of computational linguistic are related with the influence of the syntax and the semantics in the automatic classification process of texts. However, both dimensions are generally considered independently.

This thesis project seeks to explore the syntactic and semantic evolution of a text corpus over long time and the influence of these dimensions in the automatic classification process. Talking about evolution requires accurate time-related information, derived from the dates of publication for each text of the corpus. In order to observe the grammar evolution, a longer time-window and sharing a basic grammar is needed. This is why the ECCO (Eighteenth Century Collections Online) dataset will be used.
